# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Coding exercise from The Odin Project to build the game Rock Paper Scissors, all played within the console.
The first task was for the computer to randomly select/return "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors."
Then the player/user is asked to select either "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors."
The game includes the playing of 5 rounds of computer vs. user.
Each round is logged to the console and a running total of who won the most games out of 5 is declared the winner.
